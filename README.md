    For Week 3, we're required to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

# About the Project

## Requirements: User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Requirements: Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements for this week's portfolio work:

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
